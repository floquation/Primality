\section{Results}
I have simulated Argon using 864 particles for solid, liquid and gas phase.
I have succesfully computed the pressure and the pair-correlation function. I
have computed the diffusion coefficient, but an error remains. I have
parallelised the force calculation for a speed-up of 2.33 on 3 cores. Then I
have studied the phase transition from solid to liquid and posed a hypothesis
when this phase transition occures.
Future research is required to study the crystallization process (liquid to
solid), for very small temperature steps are required.
