\section{Conclusions}
%We didn't conclude anything just yet. %TODO

%For small numbers, simple techniques like trial division seem to work well.
%For big numbers, probablistic method seems to perform better.

We have looked at the behaviour of different common primality tests.
Simple deterministic algorithms work very well for small primes but get slow when tested on large numbers.

Probablitic algorithms scale well with their inputs and have small error percentages.
They also have the nice property that they can be repeated multiple times when even smaller errors are required.

AKS might be nice for theoretical reasons, but in practice the algorithm is rather slow.
Maybe the algorithm might be more practical if some optimizations are added, but currently it doesn't seem really feasible for practical purposes.
