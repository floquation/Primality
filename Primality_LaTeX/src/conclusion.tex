\section{Conclusions}
I have succesfully simulated Argon in solid, liquid and gaseous form. I have
computed the pressure, and shown that the computed pressure is in agreement with
Verlet's original paper, but as well that the pressure matches nature at
0$\cels$.
Pair-correlation functions have been created, which show clear differences
between the three phases.
I have attempted to compute the diffusion coefficient, and I have found the
right order of magnitude. At the same time, the graphs show there is still a bug
present, so further attention is needed to find more accurate predictions for
the diffusion coefficient.
I have qualitatively looked into the phase transition from solid to liquid and
theorised that the phase transition occurs when particles oscillate
sufficiently much such that they can `touch' each other and thus cause a
snowball effect, destroying the crystal lattice.
Further research is required to study this phase transition and the other 3
phase transitions in more detail.
