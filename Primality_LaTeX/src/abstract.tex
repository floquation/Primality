\begin{abstract}
We study the performance of several deterministic and randomized algorithms for primality in terms of runtime and error.
The tested algorithms are ``trial division'' (TD), ``Wheel-Sieve'' (WS), ``Solovay-Strassen'' (SS), ``Miller-Rabin'' (MR) and ``Angrawal-Kayal-Saxena'' (AKS).

Amongst the determinstic algorithms, WS had the best runtime, followed by TD.
While AKS proves that primality testing is in $P$, it performed slowest by far, because it is extremely slow on prime input.
As the input grows larger, SS and MR will eventually outperform all deterministic algorithms in terms of runtime.
In terms of error, they retain an error, but this error grows negligibly small as the input size increases.
