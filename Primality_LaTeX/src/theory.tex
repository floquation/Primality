\section{Theory}
There exist several algorithms to check whether a given integer, $n$, is a prime number.
The easiest among them all is the ``trial division'' (TD) algorithm, described in \secref{sec:TD_theory}.
It is a deterministic algorithm with a $O(\sqrt{n})$ complexity.
Several different algorithms have been devised, both deterministic and random, to beat this complexity.
