\section{Introduction}
%People spend a lot of time finding prime numbers. I don't know why\ldots
%Because they are geeks.

Prime numbers have a lot of interest to mathematicians and cryptographers.
%Factoring large numbers is thought to be a hard problem and therefore many cryptography protocols rely on the fact that factoring large numbers is hard.
Many encryption algorithms like RSA rely on the fact that factoring large numbers is hard.
Testing whether a number is prime is easier though and Angrawal, Kayal and Saxena have proven that this problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time.
However, in practice randomized algorithms are preferred because of their speed and low error probability.



% The \textit{proceedings} are the records of a conference.
% ACM seeks to give these conference by-products a uniform,
% high-quality appearance.  To do this, ACM has some rigid
% requirements for the format of the proceedings documents: there
% is a specified format (balanced  double columns), a specified
% set of fonts (Arial or Helvetica and Times Roman) in
% certain specified sizes (for instance, 9 point for body copy),
% a specified live area (18 $\times$ 23.5 cm [7" $\times$ 9.25"]) centered on
% the page, specified size of margins (1.9 cm [0.75"]) top, (2.54 cm [1"]) bottom
% and (1.9 cm [.75"]) left and right; specified column width
% (8.45 cm [3.33"]) and gutter size (.83 cm [.33"]).
% 
% The good news is, with only a handful of manual
% settings\footnote{Two of these, the {\texttt{\char'134 numberofauthors}}
% and {\texttt{\char'134 alignauthor}} commands, you have
% already used; another, {\texttt{\char'134 balancecolumns}}, will
% be used in your very last run of \LaTeX\ to ensure
% balanced column heights on the last page.}, the \LaTeX\ document
% class file handles all of this for you.
% 
% The remainder of this document is concerned with showing, in
% the context of an ``actual'' document, the \LaTeX\ commands
% specifically available for denoting the structure of a
% proceedings paper, rather than with giving rigorous descriptions
% or explanations of such commands.
